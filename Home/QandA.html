                <h2>Q and A</h2>
<h3>Why did I set up Starlight ASD Support?</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/Content/img/adhd.png" class="floatleft" />
    I set up Starlight ASD Support as I am passionate about working with children, teenagers and adults with ASD and associated difficulties.
I am keen to provide effective and appropriate support to not just individuals but the whole family.
Every person I work with has unique gifts and abilities but by drawing on my own experience, personal and professional, my focus is to help every person progress and learn new skills to help them on a daily basis. Training also provides insight to families and professionals and has been received with much gratitude from support groups and professionals alike.</p>


<h3>WHY DO I WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WITH ASD, ADHD AND SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION DIFFICULTIES?</h3>
<p>People with an ASD or associated difficulties have many special and amazing qualities and abilities which often get overlooked or remain unnoticed. Their behaviour is highly challenging and every family who lives with someone on the spectrum knows first hand the toil it takes on the whole house. in addition many people have struggled all their lives trying to fit in and wondering why life is so exhausting and challenging. Why packing a suitcase can feel so overwhelming or why can they never remember to take washing out of the machine. I offer help, support, acceptance and guidance to help in all areas of their lives.
    <img src="/Content/img/socialanxiety.png" class="floatleft" width="340" />  </p>

<p>I have always believed that rather than focusing on what people are unable to manage, I try and look beyond their difficulties, find a starting point and then slowly teach them skills at a pace and level appropriate for each individual. Working carefully with someone in this way encourages trust and enables a good relationship to be built so that they can then be encouraged to gently and willingly allow me to accept them in “their world” and help them move forwards, growing in confidence, acceptance and self esteem.

    </p>

<p> I help support them to learn new skills which will enable them over time to begin to participate and engage as their confidence, and self esteem grows with their new found social, communicative and interactive skills.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that there is potential in everyone, be it learning or saying a few words for the first time, or learning how to develop imagination or discovering how to make friends, being able to start tasks which they normally fail to commence due to procrastination which then affects their ability to function.the list is endless. I want to be able to try and give every person the chance by saying “What if....and Let’s try...because just maybe I can help turn them slowly find ways and navigate what can be a very confusing and challenging world that we all live within. Despite all the efforts for inclusion unfortunately so many people are still so ignorant of the daily challenges which face people on the spectrum.  <img src="/Content/img/starlight.png" style="float:right" width="240" />They don’t recognise how having to interact, smile and nod, shake hands and numerous other basic interaction tasks leave people exhausted and overwhelmed by the end of the day. I want to help people find ways to cope and manage and above all believe in themselves and recognise their own incredible potential.
