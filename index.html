    Within Starlight, I am able to offer 1:1 sessions for children, teenagers and adults who struggle with Autism, ADHD, communication and social interaction difficulties, especially anxiety. I help with conversational and friendship skills alongside many other essential skills people need help learning. My technique also focuses on the importance of transference of those skills which is essential to help people accept themselves and move forward. Self esteem is also a very important part of the work I do as so many people I see sadly suffer from poor self esteem and low confidence.</p> 
  
    <p class="full-box" > Sessions are in person or online and each session can be either 1 or 2 hours and include a variety of different learning skills which cover a huge range of things people find challenging and hard to manage. I also work within schools during the day, and offer 3 sessions per evening for after school sessions. I work with a cross range of ages, especially now adhd and autism is being recognised in adults and help people understand and find ways to negotiate social challenges. As an adult suddenly learning and understanding you have struggled with adhd all your life can be confusing so I offer somewhere safe people can talk through their confusion and find positive ways to move forwards.
    </p>
    <p class="full-box"> I can provide in school support, training and strategies for teachers within schools and for families I offer specific resources, strategies 
        and guidance within homes to provide full round family support and guidance.
    </p>

    <p class="full-box">When requested I can also provide training, presentations and workshops on a variety of topics.</p>

        <p>For years I was told it was all my fault. You saw and recognised her anxieties. 
    Somehow you managed to break down her “patterned responses” which others believed. You helped her to realise it was ok to ask for help. 
    When I first called you my daughter was at the point of school refusal as she felt like an “alien”. 
    School now understand her hidden anxieties, she is able to express her true feelings and she no longer hides behind a fake smile. Thank you.</p>

    talking in sentences. What more do I need to say.</p>

        I believe every child/ teenager/ adult has unique gifts and abilities and I draw on their strengths whilst working on the areas they struggle within. I liaise closely with parents and professionals and everyone involved to try and ensure full round support and care is offered to the whole family. My aim is to teach, encourage and enable every person the opportunity to progress and begin their journey reaching for their full potential. Services I am able to offer include 1:1 teaching, holiday sessions, strategies for schools and within the homes, family support and guidance plus training and presentations and workshops on a variety of topics.

        Starlight ASD Support was set up with the intention of providing guidance, support, resources and strategies in order to help children, teenagers and adults who struggle socially. A specific diagnosis is not essential but all work I do is based around people who struggle snd require help regarding social communication and interaction and the challenges that accompanies these difficulties like anxiety, self esteem, emotional regulation and accompanying difficulties.   </p>

</div>
	
<div class="left-box">
    <p>
        People with an ASD or associated difficulties have many amazing skills and qualities. However, due to the nature of ASD they may often present as socially “awkward” or withdrawn and are sometimes described as being “locked” in their own worlds; reluctant to interact and participate with others except on their own terms. On other occasions they can be described as controlling, manipulative, rigid, hyper fixated, but these are often symptoms of anxiety which is controlling their lives so i help find ways for them to talk through their fears and concerns and develop strategies to manage.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="right-box">
    <p >
        Many of their talents and skills can remain “hidden” but here at Starlight ASD Support I do not believe in putting “limits” on anyone affected by ASD or related social communication and interaction difficulties. Instead, I try to find ways to slowly help and allow them to reach out and release the potential hidden within. In order for this to happen we recognise that they may need additional support in order to learn and enhance their skills and abilities, and I am passionate about providing that support in order to make it possible.
