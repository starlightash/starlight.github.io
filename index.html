        Within Starlight, I am  able to offer 1:1 teaching, Youth Clubs & social skills groups open to all children and teenagers. </p>
    <p> These groups are divided into ability for the younger ones and teenagers have sessions on their own. </p> 
    <p> 
        I also provide specialised groups for up to 4 children per group and I try to ensure people are suited with others of similar ability and interests.
    </p>
    <p>  I can provide in school support, training and strategies for teachers within schools and for families I offer specific resources, strategies 
        and guidance within homes to provide full round family support and guidance.
    </p>

    <p>When requested I also provide training, presentations and workshops on a variety of topics.</p>

        <p>For years I was told it was all my fault. You saw and recognised her anxieties. 
    Somehow you managed to break down her “patterned responses” which others believed. You helped her to realise it was ok to ask for help. 
    When I first called you my daughter was at the point of school refusal as she felt like an “alien”. 
    School now understand her hidden anxieties, she is able to express her true feelings and she no longer hides behind a fake smile. Thank you.</p>

    I believe every child/ teenager has unique gifts and abilities and draw on their strengths whilst working on the areas they struggle within. I liaise closely with parents and professionals and everyone involved with the young person to try and ensure full round support and care is offered to the whole family. My aim is to teach, encourage and enable every person the opportunity to progress and begin their journey reaching for their full potential.
    Services I am  able to offer include 1:1 teaching, Youth Clubs & social skills, teenage groups, holiday workshops, strategies for schools and within the homes, family support and guidance plus training and presentations and workshops on a variety of topics. I also now run saturday groups in our Portsmouth Venue. These are small groups, focusing on specific social skills and I try to ensure people are suited with others of similar ability and interests.

        Starlight ASD Support was set up with the intention of providing guidance, support, resources and strategies in order to help children and teenagers with an ASD (autistic spectrum disorder) or a Social Communication and Interaction difficulty.
    </p>

        People with an ASD or associated difficulties have many amazing skills and qualities. However, due to the nature of ASD they may often present as socially “awkward” or withdrawn and are sometimes  described as being “locked” in their own worlds; reluctant to interact and participate with others except on their own terms.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="right-box">
    <p >
        Many of their talents and skills can remain “hidden” but here at Starlight ASD Support I do not believe in putting “limits” on anyone affected by ASD or related social communication and interaction difficulties. Instead, I try to find ways to slowly help and allow them to reach out and release the potential hidden within. In order for this to happen we recognise that they may need additional support in order to learn and enhance their skills and abilities, and I am passionate about providing that support in order to make it possible.
